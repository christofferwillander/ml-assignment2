**Assignment 2 in the course Machine Learning (DV2578). Evaluation of classifiers using 10-fold stratified cross-validation in scikit-learn and the Friedman and Nemenyi tests.**

## General information
Model information, model performance metrics are printed in the terminal after execution of the *spam-classifier.py* script based on the *Spambase* data set from *UCI Machine Learning Repository*. Furthermore, each performance metric is ranked for every model during all iterations. This ranking is later used in the Friedman and Nemenyi tests.

## Setup
**Requirements:** *Python 3.9.9*, *pip 21.2.4*, *pandas*, *scikit-learn*, *scipy*, *numpy*, *columnar*.

Simply install Python and pip, and then run the *pip install -r requirements.txt* command in the terminal to install all the required packages.
**N.B.** Make sure CWD is the root of the assignment folder.


## Script execution
The script is executed by simply typing *python spam-classifier.py* in the terminal while the CWD is the root of the assignment folder.
